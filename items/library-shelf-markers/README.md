# library shelf markers

There are four CAD models for library shelf markers. Use like that:
1. Choose a file
* ‘1 shelf marker’ is the standard case
* use ‘2 shelf marker upright’ when the last section has few book or a long title
* use ‘3 shelf marker 2-line’ for long titles with more than one word
* use ‘4 shelf marker upright’ if you have only one book in one section
* use ‘5 shelf marker middle’ for finicky filaments
2. Then write your title into ‘word_text’, adjust ‘width’ (or ‘height’ in case of ‘4 books-marker upright’), export and print. Printing works best when turned on the left side. Stick it between your books and enjoy your well organized book shelf.
